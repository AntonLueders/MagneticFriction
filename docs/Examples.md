Here, we present some simple examples, which describe how to run **MagneticFriction** and how to use the data generated by the simulations. If some steps are unclear, please check [README](../README.md).

1) Performing your first simulations with **MagneticFriction**

As an example for the execution of the simulations, the following steps describe how to run numerical calculations for three distinct slider-substrate separations (6.5mm, 8.8mm, and 11.0mm). First, download all **.m** files corresponding to **MagneticFriction** from this repository into a single folder. Then, open **MagneticArray.m** with Matlab. Go to line 82 and adjust the variable *scan_value* so that the line reads:
```
scan_value = [0.0065, 0.0085, 0.011];
```
Here, *scan_value* represents the three separations for which the calculations are performed. The simulation can be started by executing **MagneticArray.m** in MATLAB.

If the simulations are successful, three **.mat** files can be found in the folder that contains **MagneticArray.m** (*height0.0065.mat*, *height0.0085.mat*, and *height0.011.mat*). These files contain the output data and can be utilized for further analysis. The simulation program is expected to run roughly 900 seconds per separation on an *AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7730U*.
