Here, we present simplified pseudocode for the particular Matlab files of **MagneticFriction** to highlight the basic principles behind the simulations. However, please see the [Readme](../README.md) and the supporting information of [1] for more informations.

**Translation.m** 

```pseudo

(New positions of the moments) = (old position of the moments) + velocity x time_step
